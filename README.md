A simple Python program that checks the strength of a password based on:
- Length (minimum 8 characters)
- Use of uppercase letters
- Use of lowercase letters
- Use of digits
- Use of special characters (e.g. !, @, #, $)

## How it Works 🏢
The program assigns points based on password rules:
 +1 if length >= 8

+1 if contains uppercase letters

+1 if contains lowercase letters

+1 if contains digits

+1 if contains special characters

Score → Result

0–2 → Weak ❌

3–4 → Medium ⚠️

5 → Strong ✅

## In the Future🔮

☑️ Add Gui

❌ Add Password generator

❌ Check pwned and other sites to check if password was leaked in an breach

❌ Option to exit the loop
