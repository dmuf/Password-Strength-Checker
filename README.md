## How it Works 🏢
The program assigns points based on password rules:
 +1 if length >= 8

+1 if contains uppercase letters

+1 if contains lowercase letters

+1 if contains digits

+1 if contains special characters

Score → Result

0–2 → Weak ❌

3–4 → Medium ⚠️

5 → Strong ✅

✅ Add Password generator

☑️Check pwned and other sites to check if password was leaked in an breach

✅ Option to exit the loop
